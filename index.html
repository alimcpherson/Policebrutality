		<p>The rate of black women killed by police has risen in the last nine years, but they aren’t the only ones.</p>

		<p>This year alone, sixty-four white women were killed, while thirty-seven black women were killed. In 2018 the amount of white women killed by police more than doubled the number of black women killed by police.</p>

		<p>For both black and white women, during a fatal encounter with police, the cause of death is most likely to be by  vehicle crash. The second most likely cause of death is by gunshot wounds.</p>


		<p>Dennis Kenney, a professor of Criminal Justice at John Jay College was not surprised by the study. “That more women are killed in traffic accidents with police than are shot by them likely speaks to just how few women of either race police shoot.”</p>


		<p>Just over a month ago, an African American woman, Atatiana Jefferson, 28 was gunned down by a Fort Worth officer. The killing of Jefferson sparked outrage from the black community and based on the data, Jefferson is one of many black women who have been killed over the years by a firearm.


		</p> During the start of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, forty-two black women were killed by police which was the highest it's been for black women between 2000 and 2019. After the Black Lives Matter movement, the rate of black women killed by the police has declined. </p>

	</p> For white women, the rate of women killed by police is the lowest it's been in five years.
