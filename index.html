		<h1> The Invisible Fatal Encounters</h1>
	<p class= "subtitle"> Despite studies that show African Americans are more likely to be killed by the police in the U.S., a recent study shows that more white women have been killed by the police than black women.</p>

		<p>The rate of black women killed by police has risen in the last nine years, but they aren’t the only ones.</p>

		<p>This year alone, sixty-four white women were killed, while thirty-seven black women were killed. In 2018 the amount of white women killed by police more than doubled the number of black women killed by police</p>

		<p>For both black and white women, during a fatal encounter with police, the cause of death was most liekly to be by gunshot or vehicle related death.</p>

		<p>Just over a month ago Atiana Jefferson, 28 was gunned down by a Fort Worth officer The killing of Jefferson not only sparked outrage because of the outrageousness of the situation, but also because she was yet another black body gunned down by police </p>

		<p>Dennis Kenney, a professor of Criminal Justice at John Jay College was not surprised by the recent study. “That more women are killed in traffic accidents with police than are shot by them likely speaks to just how few women of either race police shoot.”
